Well, hello!

This is me learning a few new tricks, nothing fancy. I've always looked at some of those very shiny blogs and websites out on the internet and wondered about the effort behind them.  

This time, I decided to take a longer look and found about [GitHub Pages][1], [Jekyll][2] and many other things.
After a few hours of "investigation", I settled on the [{ personal }][3] theme by Panos Sakkos.  

I'll be adding a few things over time, such as my employment history and my public contributions as a speaker or writer and blogging mostly about cloud adoption in the Service Provider space and the occasional personal post.
